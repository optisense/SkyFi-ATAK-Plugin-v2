# Security Recommendations for SkyFi ATAK Plugin v2

## üîí Current Security Status: GOOD ‚úÖ

Your repository follows most security best practices. Here are recommendations to make it even more secure:

## High Priority Fixes

### 1. Enhanced .gitignore Patterns
Your current `.gitignore` is good, but add these additional security patterns:

```gitignore
# Sensitive files
*.keystore
*.jks
*.p12
*.pem
*.key
local.properties
keystore.properties

# Environment files
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local

# Build artifacts that might contain sensitive info
app/build/
.gradle/
build/

# IDE files that might contain paths
.idea/
*.iml

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Backup files
*.bak
*.backup
*.tmp

# Log files
*.log
logs/

# Temporary files
temp/
tmp/
```

### 2. Environment Variable Configuration
Replace hardcoded development passwords in `app/build.gradle`:

```gradle
// Instead of hardcoded passwords
storePassword System.getenv("DEBUG_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD") ?: "tnttnt"
keyPassword System.getenv("DEBUG_KEY_PASSWORD") ?: "tnttnt"
```

## Medium Priority Improvements

### 3. Add Security Policy
Create `.github/SECURITY.md`:
```markdown
# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Please report security vulnerabilities to: security@optisense.com

Do NOT create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions
- v2.x: ‚úÖ Supported
- v1.x: ‚ùå No longer supported
```

### 4. Add Dependabot for Security Updates
Create `.github/dependabot.yml`:
```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "gradle"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
```

### 5. GitHub Actions Security
Add to your workflow files:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  actions: read
  security-events: write
```

## Low Priority Enhancements

### 6. Code Scanning
Add GitHub Advanced Security code scanning to detect vulnerabilities automatically.

### 7. Secrets Scanning
Enable GitHub secret scanning to prevent accidental commits of API keys.

### 8. Branch Protection
Enable branch protection rules:
- Require PR reviews
- Require status checks
- Restrict pushes to main branch

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] No API keys or passwords in source code
- [ ] `.gitignore` includes all sensitive file patterns  
- [ ] Development vs production configs separated
- [ ] Security policy documented
- [ ] Automated security scanning enabled
- [ ] Branch protection rules configured

## Emergency Response

If you accidentally commit sensitive information:
1. Immediately rotate any exposed credentials
2. Remove from git history using `git filter-branch`
3. Force push to update remote repository
4. Notify team members to re-clone repository
