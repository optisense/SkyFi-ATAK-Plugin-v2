SelfMarkerData Plugin


_________________________________________________________________
PURPOSE AND CAPABILITIES

Sample program developed during the developers training track 
September 22-24 2020.   

Problem Statement #1

ACME Sensors has decided to contract to you to build a plugin that reads data from their sensor and push the information over the network both locally and through a TAK server.    The data will be the heart rate of the TAK user.   The data they provide is the maximum and average heart rate over a period of time.    At the end of the technical exchange, everyone has decided that the information can be captured using this format

<health maxHeartRate="80" averageHeartRate="65" start="2019-01-23T21:22:55.3074679Z" stop="2019-01-23T21:23:55.3074679Z"/>

The plugin you build will be able to insert this data into the current SA message being sent by the TAK device and allow for a receiver to visualize when they have your plugin.
